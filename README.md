### The notebook contains several key steps:

## Environment Setup:

- Cloned the LLaMA Factory repository
- Installed required dependencies including transformers, datasets, accelerate, peft, and others
- Installed additional libraries like bitsandbytes and liger-kernel


## Model Training:

- Using the Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct as the base model
- Applied LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning
- Utilized a custom dataset (mllm_demo and identity)
- Configured training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs
- Employed mixed precision training (fp16) and gradient checkpointing for efficiency


## Model Merging and Exporting:

- Merged the LoRA adapters with the base model
- Exported the merged model to a specified directory


## Hugging Face Hub Integration:

- Uploaded the merged model to a specified repository on Hugging Face Hub


## Technical Details:

- Employs the transformers library for model architecture and tokenization
- Utilized accelerate for distributed training capabilities
- Implemented LoRA via the peft library
- Used gradio for potential web UI interactions (though not explicitly used in this notebook)
- Configured the model for visual-language tasks, as evident from the use of Qwen2-VL model
